# 📚 Library Management App

Welcome to the **Library Management App** project! This project is a collaborative effort to develop a comprehensive library management application using **Android Studio** and **Kotlin** for the frontend, and **PHP** for the backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KangBubur1/uas_mobile.git
    ```
2. **Open the project in Android Studio:**
    - Launch Android Studio.
    - Select `Open an existing project`.
    - Navigate to the cloned repository and select it.

3. **Build and run the app:**
    - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
    - Click on the `Run` button in Android Studio.

### Backend Setup

1. **Install XAMPP:**
    - Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
    - Start the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP control panel.

2. **Clone the repository and set up the backend:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-repository/library-management-app](https://github.com/KangBubur1/uas_mobile)-backend.git
    ```
    - Move the cloned backend folder to the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.

3. **Import the database:**
    - Open [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/).
    - Create a new database (e.g., `library_db`).
    - Import the provided SQL file (`library_db.sql`) located in the backend folder.
